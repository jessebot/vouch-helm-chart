# To get started helping out
Please install [pre-commit] and [helm-docs] locally and then install our pre-commit hooks.

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install-hooks
```

Right now, these just keep the docs up to date, but in the future, will provide other useful tools :)

[helm-docs]: https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs#installation
